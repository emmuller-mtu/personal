I've always been interested in the collaboration between art and music, and wanted to see if I could build a process for creating an immersive experience of both.

AIMV is a Jupyter Notebook project for generating 3-D VR Music Videos using AI and Spotify Track Analysis. It allows a user to search for a track and then creates VR180 videos with 3D art generated by Disco Diffusion, informed by track analysis by Spotify's API. This was an interesting project to explore and investigate what makes good AI text prompts, how audio can be translated to visuals, and what kind of personalized experience can be created for a user.
